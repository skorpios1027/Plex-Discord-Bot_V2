        * This will provide you with your bot Username and Token
5. Take all of the information from the page and enter it into the `config/keys.js` file, replacing the placeholders.
6. Navigate to the `config/plex.js` file and replace the placeholders with your Plex Server information
    1. To get your token, following the instructions here: https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/204059436-Finding-an-authentication-token-X-Plex-Token
    2. The identifier, product, version, and deviceName can be anything you want
7. If it is desired to have a set voice channel for the Bot to play the music on, get the channel ID of the channel you want the bot to operate in.
	1. In The Discord application go to **Settings > Appearance > Check developer mode**.
	2. Right click channel name and copy the channel ID (**Copy ID**).
	3. open the 'config/config.js' file and enter the ID into the 'defaultVChan' field.
8. Once you have the configs set up correctly, you'll need to authorize your bot on a server you have administrative access to.  For documentation, you can read: https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#bots.  The steps are as follows:
    1. Go to `https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=[CLIENT ID]&permissions=3197953&scope=bot` where [CLIENT_ID] is the Discord App Client ID
    2. Select **Add a bot to a server** and select the server to add it to
    3. Click **Authorize**
    4. You should now see your bot in your server listed as *Offline*.

If want want to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), just go to the Docker section.

9. To bring your bot *Online*, navigate to the root of the app (where `plex-bot.js` is located) and in your console, type `node plex-bot.js`
    * This will start your server.  The console will need to be running for the bot to run.
	* Alternatively, you can daemonize the bot using pm2 (https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2)

## Docker
If you are using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), you can use these commands to build and start your Plex bot (after downloading the source code and set the config file) :

go to your plex bot folder (`cd your/plex/bot/folder`)

`docker build -t image/plexbot .`

`docker run -p 32400 -d --name plexbot image/plexbot`

wait a few seconds and your bot should join your server and be active.
You can use `docker logs plexbot` to see the log of the bot (use `docker logs -f plexbot` if you want realtime log).

Note : you may need the `sudo` command/admin access depending of your user right.
## Usage

1. Join a Discord voice channel.
2. Upon playing a song, the bot will join your channel and play your desired song.
